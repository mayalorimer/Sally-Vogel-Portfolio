        "description": "A memorial for the wildlife that have been killed or had to flee due to wildfires. This memorial is designed to be a den or protective nest for animals and will decay and decompose as the burnt land replenishes and grows. All that will remain, once the land is healthy again, is a stone plaque with the date of the fire. The color of the inside of the memorial is a red-orange color that attracts birds. And birds are the first hope for bringing life back to this area. They fly and drop seeds and other materials which will inevitably bring new life over time."
